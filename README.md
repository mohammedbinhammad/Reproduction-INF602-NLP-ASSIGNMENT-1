Using a thumbs-up sentiment classification, we can categorize movie reviews and provide a streamlined description of each using a feature-based summary. To determine the most effective method for classifying sentiment using machine learning, experiments are performed. 
We use logistic regression, SVM, and CNN classification models, similar to the conventional topic-based categorization. 
We demonstrate that the proposed model greatly outperforms current strong baselines through extensive experimentation on four benchmark datasets. The accuracy of the classification and response time of the system are the primary focuses of the design of the system.
