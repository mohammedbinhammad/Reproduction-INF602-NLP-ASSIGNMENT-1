Using a thumbs-up sentiment classification, we can categorize movie reviews and provide a streamlined description of each using a feature-based summary. 
To determine the most effective method for classifying sentiment using machine learning, experiments are performed. 
We discover that common machine learning algorithms unquestionably outperform baselines created by humans using movie reviews as input. 
However, machine learning methods like Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines are not as effective in sentiment analysis. 
Also, we used logistic regression, SVM, and CNN classification models, similar to the conventional topic-based categorization. In order to summarize, we look at what makes the sentiment classification task more difficult. 
This is often represented as a linear series or a tree. 
We demonstrate that the proposed model greatly outperforms current strong baselines through extensive experimentation on four benchmark datasets. 
The accuracy of the classification as well as the response time of the system are the primary focuses of the design of the system.
